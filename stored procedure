# understanding stored procedure
Stored procedures are simply colletions of one or more MariaDB statements
saved for future use. You can think of them as batch files, although in truth
they are more than that.

# why use stored procedures
1 to simplify complex operations
2 to ensure data integrity by not requiring that a series of steps be created
over and over.
3 to simplify change management.
4 to improve performance, as stored procedures typically execute quicker than 
do individual statements.

simplicity, security, and performance.

# usage
1 R
  call productpricing(@pricelow,
                      @pricehigh,
                      @priceaverage);
2 C
  create procedure productpricing()
  begin
    select avg(prod_price) as priceaverage
    from products;
  end;
3 D
drop procedure productpricing;
4 parameters
create procedure productpricing(
  out pl decimal(8, 2),
  out ph decimal(8, 2),
  out pa decimal(8, 2)
)
begin 
  select min(pro_price)
  into pl
  from products;
  select max(pro_price)
  into ph
  from products;
  select avg(pro_price)
  into pa
  from products;
end;

call productpricing(@pricelow, @pricehigh, @priceaverage);
select @priceaverage;

create procedure ordertotal(
  in onumber int,
  out ototal decimal(8, 2)
)
begin
  select sum(item_price*quantity)
  from orderitems
  where order_num = onumber
  into ototal;
end;

call ordertotal(20005, @total);
select @ototal;

# 5 intelligent stored procedures
create procedure ordertotal (
  in onumber int,
  in taxable boolean,
  out ototal decimal(8, 2)
)
begin 
  declare total decimal(8, 2);
  declare tax int default 6;
  
  select sum(item_price*quantity)
  from orderitems
  where order_num = onumber
  into total;
  
  if taxable then
    select total+(total/100*taxrate) into total;
  endif;
  
  select total into ototal;
end;

# 5 R
show create procudure ordertotal;
