# understanding triggers
A trigger is a mariadb statement that are automatically executed by maraidb
in response to any of these statements:
delete
insert
update

only tables not no views.

# C
create trigger newproduct after insert on products
for each row
begin
end;

# D
drop trigger newpruduct;

# R
1 insert trigger
virtual table named new

create trigger neworder after insert on orders
fro each row
begin
  insert into orders_log(changed_on, change_type, order_num)
  values(Now(), 'A', New.order_num);
end;

before vs after
use after if you need to access data that won't exist until a statement has been
processed
use before for data validation and cleanup

2 delete triggers
virtual table named old
create trigger deleteorder before delete on orders
for each row
begin
  insert into orders_log(changed_on, change_type, order_num)
  values(Now(), 'D', OLD.order_num);
end;

3 update triggers
virtual table old
virtual table new
create trigger updatevendor before update on vendors
for each row set new.vend_state = upper(new.vend_state);

# notes
stored  procedures cannot be invoked from within triggers.
