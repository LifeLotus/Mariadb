# understanding views
views are virtual tables, views simply contain queries that dynamically
retrieve data when used.

# usage
1 reuse SQL statements
2 simplify complex SQL operations.
3 to expose parts of a table instead of complete tables.
4 to secure data
5 to chage data formatting and representation.

# notes
1 order by may be used in a view, but it will be overriden if order by is 
also used in the select statement.
2 can be nested
3 views cannot be indexed, nor can they have triggers or default values.
4 views can be used in conjunction with tables.

# using
1 C create view
2 R show create view viewname;
3 D drop view viewname;
4 U replace view or create view;
